# Halting my real person fanfiction (fanfic)

I, ShlomiÂ Fish, writer, software developer and amateur philosopher, have decided
to halt my real person fanfiction until further notice. However, I'd like to
note why it may have been a blessing in disguise.

# The Technion vs. Project Euler

I joked that my opinion on [The Technion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technion_%E2%80%93_Israel_Institute_of_Technology), the University where I completed
my EE B.Sc degree has become "untwitterable". The more I think about it seems
that I think less highly of it, despite what some people told me that it
wasn't a waste of time, and that I'll reminiscient about my studies.

I paid money to study there and the people whom were indirectly paid by me,
while sometimes being helpful, often had limited time to help me, looked down
upon me, and gave me hard tests and unfair grades. It destroyed my self-esteem,
harmed my health, made me maniacal, put me on antipsychotics which harmed
my health further, and taught me little of lasting value. Despite paying I
didn't enjoy it, and only did it to get the diploma, so i can get a more
lucrative job later on.

Paying and get paid made the experience worse. This is the curse of professionalism.

Many years later, I started solving problems at [Project Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Euler), one of many [competitive programming](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/problem-sets-competitive-programming.md). Since I had quite a bit of math and programming background,
I did quite well at it having solver over 300 problems.
I didn't have to pay but I voluntarily paid a small donation.
I am still unhappy by the somewhat degraded UX, but am otherwise very happy.

Despite not paying or expecting to be paid, or rather because of it, I was
met with gratitude, respect and admiration by the people I helped on
[freenode](https://freenode.net/) with previous problems I solved or by
announcing that I have solved a new one - also without paying.

I was much happier as an amateur - someone who does what he do for fun,
not to get paid.

## Taylor Swift as an amateur

Someone on freenode complained how much he disliked Apple's Swift language
(which you may not have heard of) and I suggested he charge more - maybe 300
USD - which he said no one can afford. Since it reminded me of
[Taylor Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift) - a successful
and popular
