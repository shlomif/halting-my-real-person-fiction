# Halting my real person fanfiction (fanfic)

I, ShlomiÂ Fish, writer, software developer and amateur philosopher, have decided
to halt my real person fanfiction until further notice. However, I'd like to
note why it may have been a blessing in disguise.

# The Technion vs. Project Euler

I joked that my opinion on [The Technion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technion_%E2%80%93_Israel_Institute_of_Technology), the University where I completed
my EE B.Sc degree has become "untwitterable". The more I think about it seems
that I think less highly of it, despite what some people told me that it
wasn't a waste of time, and that I'll reminiscient about my studies.

I paid money to study there and the people whom were indirectly paid by me,
while sometimes being helpful, often had limited time to help me, looked down
upon me, and gave me hard tests and unfair grades. It destroyed my self-esteem,
harmed my health, made me maniacal, put me on antipsychotics which harmed
my health further, and taught me little of lasting value. Despite paying I
didn't enjoy it, and only did it to get the diploma, so i can get a more
lucrative job later on.

Paying and getting paid made the experience worse. This is the curse of professionalism.

Many years later, I started solving problems at [Project Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Euler), one of many [competitive programming sites](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/problem-sets-competitive-programming.md). Since I had quite a bit of math and programming background,
I did quite well at it having solved over 300 problems.
I didn't have to pay but I voluntarily paid a small donation.
I am still unhappy by the somewhat degraded UX, but am otherwise very happy.

Despite not paying or expecting to be paid, or rather because of it, I was
met with gratitude, respect and admiration by the people I helped on
[freenode](https://freenode.net/) with previous problems I solved or by
announcing that I have solved a new one - also without paying.

I was much happier as an amateur - someone who does what he do for fun,
not to get paid.

Lately by inspiration from a correspondent on a chat who gave me a free advice
for emulating my ["I'm a Rock Star Resume"](https://www.shlomifish.org/me/resumes/Shlomi-Fish-Resume-as-Software-Dev.html) where I included only amateur achievements, including Project Euler and excluded the Technion. At first I thought it was because EE B.Sc. degrees are not notable enough. But then I realised: I wasn't proud of it. These were my most vexing, toxic, soul destroying, unproductive six years of my life. I regret doing it for greed of money.

That junkie stand up comedian whom i saw at a captioned twitter video was right: if you want to succeed as a writer, entertainer and amateur philosopher: don't work "hard".

## Taylor Swift as an amateur

Someone on freenode complained how much he disliked [Apple's Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language))
programming language
(which you may not have heard of) and I suggested he charge more - maybe 300
USD / hour - which he said no one can afford. Its name reminded me of
[Taylor Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift) - a successful
and popular singer, who has many videos on YouTube, some of which I am fond
of and many people praise. You probably heard of her. Now, I told him
that she probably charges more than 300 USD/hour, but the fact of the matter
she might perform even for free for something that is important to her
because performing is fun. Her videos despite often being popular probably
do not offset their production value in ads, but they are good publicity,
provide fodder for remixes, parodies and covers, and are fun enough to produce so she can afford
to offset the cost. She doesn't work for money or even for a shitload of
money. She works for fun.

There is likely a lot of fanfic, fanart, comments and idolisations of her
on the Internet. She may not improve significantly but she can derive inspiration
and comments from them, and even if she is criticised or held in contempt,
she can either ignore that criticism or learn from it.

If I wrote a Real Person Fanfic of Taylor Swift, she won't be harmed or care.
If I depicted her figuratively "kicking the ass" of the NSA in [Summerschool at the NSA](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/)
it would not have harmed her reputation a dent and it may have even give her good publicity and even fodder for songs or videos.

As an amateur it would not have harmed her, and I would not have been
considered a villain.

But I did not.

## Sarah Michelle Gellar and Summer Glau

Instead I sent [Sarah Michelle Gellar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Michelle_Gellar), and [Summer Glau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Glau), two
actresses who seemed invaluable for that due to previous associations, and
while their acting careers were already on the brink of termination, and I
depicted them positively, likely may have sealed the envelope on both of their
careers. Why?

Because they are professionals. The better they played, the more they were
scorned and maligned and given poor roles by other jealous professional movie
makers who were jealous of their competency and elevated perception by amateur
fans who knew better. There is a whole [YouTube search about why Hollywood cannot cast X anymore](https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1174571159372935168) but
it is the same old story. To paraphrase on an old original Star Trek series
quote: "it does not happen some of the time. It happens all the time."

But in the music industry it never happens. It will be very preposterous to
hear "Why no one will hear The Beatles anymore." and even though
[Christina Grimmie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Grimmie) was killed
(in part due to her own mismanagement), and I was shocked and saddened by that,
her songs are still popular and if I
now rewrote my screenplay depicting her as a super intelligent and resourceful female who
kicks the ass of the NSA, people will think I am helping keep her legacy
alive and rever me for it.

## JK Roling vs. Me

I want to become the next big writer, but I want to remain writing for fun,
publishing for free on my site under Creative Commons licences, and writing
mostly fanfic or even real person fiction. People feel sorry for JK Roling for being a professional, despite her being a millionaire.

But people like me, respect me or even think I'm prepostorous or blasphemous
(which indicates I may be right - http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Encourage_criticism_and_try_to_get_offended/ ). People would cringe at reading the Harry
Potter books now ("TL;DR") but many of my old stories, aphorisms or factoids are
still funny and fresh.

You may not know who she is but https://twitter.com/EmmaWatson is the most
highly paid actress in Hollywood. But it's not as if she is the new Arnold
Schwarzenegger. Instead, Arnold Schwarzenegger is the old Emma Watson!
Poor Emma. Why do we feel sorry for her?

Let me try it again. It's not as if Taylor Swift was the new Madonna. In fact,
Swift is the new Socrates! I'm sure Ms. Swift will approve of the new Taylor
Swift factoid.

It does not have to be this way.

## Actors are not replaceable

Jewel Staite [testified](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e3t1f/jewel_staite_ama/cjvt8t9/) that only she and Summer Glau could have played their
characters on Firefly. Similarly I am more and more convinced that only
Emma Watson can play Selina on [Selina-Mandrake](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/) but I'd like her to do it for fun and work for relatively
little. It will be prepostorous to assume that the late Christina Grimmie can
ever be
replaced by [Tiffany Alvord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Alvord)
or even be Taylor Swift even though all three are wonderful singers.

Actors should become amateurs and work for fun on amateur films they like by
amateur writers who like me write mainly fanfic and often crossovers and even
real person fiction. As much as I like Kermit the Frog or Lucky Luke they
should star along [Chuck Norris and Summer Glau](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Muppets-Show-TNI/Summer-Glau-and-Chuck-Norris.html) because they are equally
awesome even if real.

Chuck Norris and Bruce Lee are the last in line of master professional warriors
(believed to have passed through [Saladin](http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Saladin_Style/) himself - one of the greatest and most underrated hackers of all time)
but I believe some of the newer amateur MMA fighters could have overcome even Bruce Lee himself.

Former professional actors like Emma Watson, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Summer
Glau and Chuck Norris who the better they become the more they were resented,
hated, envied and mistreated until they hit their breaking point. Simply because
they were professionals and were paid money.

It is possible that the reason it seems like [Chuck Norris Facts](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Chuck-Norris/) have made a comeback
recently is because Norris has decided to play in roles he liked, even if he
got paid little. He became a happy respected amateur.

But for now I'll write my real person fic on singers and YouTube musicians.
I already have one more factoid about Taylor Swift and there doubtless will be more.
And I assure you that for a long time you won't see a youtube video "Why people
won't listen to Taylor Swift's songs again?" Poor Taylor! I'm sure she won't survive reading this Taylor Swift Factoid, and sue me immediately.
