# Halting my real person fanfiction (fanfic)

I, ShlomiÂ Fish, writer, software developer and amateur philosopher, have decided
to halt my real person fanfiction until further notice. However, I'd like to
note why it may have been a blessing in disguise.

# The Technion vs. Project Euler

I joked that my opinion on [The Technion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technion_%E2%80%93_Israel_Institute_of_Technology), the University where I completed
my EE B.Sc degree has become "untwitterable". The more I think about it seems
that I think less highly of it, despite what some people told me that it
wasn't a waste of time, and that I'll reminiscient about my studies.

I paid money to study there and the people whom were indirectly paid by me,
while sometimes being helpful, often had limited time to help me, looked down
upon me, and gave me hard tests and unfair grades. It destroyed my self-esteem,
harmed my health, made me maniacal, put me on antipsychotics which harmed
my health further, and taught me little of lasting value. Despite paying I
didn't enjoy it, and only did it to get the diploma, so i can get a more
lucrative job later on.

Paying and get paid made the experience worse. This is the curse of professionalism.

Many years later, I started solving problems at [Project Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Euler), one of many [competitive programming](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/problem-sets-competitive-programming.md). Since I had quite a bit of math and programming background,
I did quite well at it having solver over 300 problems.
I didn't have to pay but I voluntarily paid a small donation.
I am still unhappy by the somewhat degraded UX, but am otherwise very happy.

Despite not paying or expecting to be paid, or rather because of it, I was
met with gratitude, respect and admiration by the people I helped on
[freenode](https://freenode.net/) with previous problems I solved or by
announcing that I have solved a new one - also without paying.

I was much happier as an amateur - someone who does what he do for fun,
not to get paid.

## Taylor Swift as an amateur

Someone on freenode complained how much he disliked Apple's Swift language
(which you may not have heard of) and I suggested he charge more - maybe 300
USD / hour - which he said no one can afford. It reminded me of
[Taylor Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift) - a successful
and popular singer, who has many videos on YouTube, some of which I am fond
of and many people praise. You probably heard of her. Now, I told him
that she probably charges more than 300 USD/hour, but the fact of the matter
she might perform even for free for something that is important to her
because performing is fun. Her videos despite often being popular probably
do not offset their production value in ads, but they are good publicity,
provide fodder for remixes, and are fun enough to produce so she can afford
to offset the cost. She doesn't work for money or even for a shitload of
money. She works for fun.

There is likely a lot of fanfic, fanart, comments and idolisations of her
on the Internet. She may not improve significantly but she can derive inspiration
and comments from them, and even if she is criticised or held in contempt,
she can either ignore that criticism or learn from it.

If I wrote a Real Person Fanfic of Taylor Swift, she won't be harmed or care.
If I depicted her figuratively "kicking the ass" of the NSA in [Summerschool at the NSA](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/)
her reputation
would not have been harmed a dent and it may have even give her good publicity and even fodder for songs or videos.

As an amateur it would not have harmed her, and I would not have been
considered a villain.

But I did not.

## Sarah Michelle Gellar and Summer Glau

Instead I sent [Sarah Michelle Gellar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Michelle_Gellar) and [Summer Glau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Glau) two
actresses who seemed invaluable for that due to previous associations, and
while their acting careers were already on the brink of termination, and I
depicted them positively likely may have sealed the envelope on both of her
careers. Why?

Because they are professionals. The better they played, the more they were
scorned and maligned and given poor roles by other jealous professional movie
makers who were jealous of their competency and elevated perception by amateur
fans who knew better. There is a whole [YouTube search about why Hollywood cannot cast X anymore](https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1174571159372935168) but
it is the same old story. To paraphrase on an old original Star Trek series
quote: "it does not happen some of the time. It happens all the time."

But in the music industry it never happens. It will be very preposterous to
hear "Why no one will hear The Beatles anymore." and even though
[Christina Grimmie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Grimmie) was killed
(in part due to her own mismanagement) her songs are still popular and if I
now rewrote my screenplay depicting her as a super intelligent female who
kicks the ass of the NSA, people will think I am helping keep her legacy
alive and rever me for it.
